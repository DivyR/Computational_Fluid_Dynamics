# Fluid_Dynamics_Simulation

An assignment for CSC190 course (*at the University of Toronto*) which simulates the thermal-fluid dynamics of a system using differential-burger equations and libraries to generate a visualization.

<p id="small-text" style="font-size:10px;">The structure of the code as been improved in comparison to the submission to improve organization and readability of the program.</p>
